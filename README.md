# Resume
### Education:
Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering, PES University, India, with specialisation in Communications. Minor degree in Computer Science and Engineering, PES Univesity, India. *(Aug 2017 - May 2021)*

### Research Experience:
Publications: [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vSz9WAIAAAAJ)
*Pneumonia and Covid Detection from Chest X-Ray*
1. Remodelled the already existing CheXNET to give the probability of a lung X-ray being normal, pneumonic or other lung diseases. 
2. Performed segmentation on the pre-processed images using UNET.
3. Fine-tuning the model to reduce false negatives as a radiology lab in Bangalore adopted this model to aid the front-line workers during the pandemic. 
   
*Multimodal Data Fusion using R-Vine Copula*
1. Formulated an architectural model that provided optimal dimensionality reduction using Pearson's coefficient, Predictive Power Score for feature selection, and R-Vine copula for fusion.
2. To obtain a generic architectural design, I analysed various tree estimation and detection techniques that enable the model to organise the optimal tree structure and pick the copula functions that best model complex dependencies of the input data for fusion.
3. To validate the effectiveness of our representation and fusion framework, we conducted experiments using STISEN: Human Activity Recognition dataset and Transport Mode Detection dataset. The outputs obtained from this model were then fed to a standard classification model to compare against the previous algorithms, with our model proving superior.
   
*Acute Infarct Detection in Brain MRI*
1. Worked with a partner to build a supervised learning CNN that predicts the tumor location in brain MRI with very low input data availability.
2. Worked with a dataset of 50 brain MRI images and corresponding infarct locations. [link to code](https://github.com/yogya-ch/Acute_infarct)

### Industry Experience:
*Software Development Engineer and Test @ Amazon India* *(Aug 2021- Aug 2023)*
1. Discussed with various teams and members to gather the needs and requirement for testing frameworks.
Then, worked on designing and developing a test framework on AWS to support shadow testing.
2. Developed a dashboard web application to show consolidated realtime report of projects, tasks and automation results for Amazon Prime Team.
3. Designed DB schema and implementing backend Lambda functions to support the development of a
Dashboard Web Application to track operational excellence and automation metrics.

*Summer Intern @Technovation Center, Wipro Ltd*
1. Intern at the R&D - Technovation Center of Wipro
2. Created a Web AR application to allow customers try out best fit cloths on personalized 3D model without
out actually visiting the store or install new apps. ([Some testing snippets](https://yogyach.github.io/webAR/))
